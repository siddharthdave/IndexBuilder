**************** General Notes  *********************
1) The code is developed and tested on Windows.
2) It uses BOOST c++ library ( for hash tables and serialization).
3) Apart from BOOST there is no other external dependency & this must work on all platforms ( Linux/OS-X)

******************Building  ***********************
1) Download latest BOOST from: http://www.boost.org/users/download/
2) Include a reference to the path in the Visual Studio Solution ( or otherwise in the compiler command line option on other platforms)
3) compile and link !

******************Running **************************
There are 2 easy steps:

1) First create the index from corpus:
"CorpusBuilder.exe build path_to_the_tsv_document"

This will create a file '_index.bin'.

2) Load the '_index.bin' file:
"CorpusBuilder.exe server path_to_index.bin_file"

This will start the sever and now you can enter query in an interactive way. The top3 documents are returned. This may be changed in the code.
